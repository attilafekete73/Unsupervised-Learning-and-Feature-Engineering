# Unsupervised-Learning-and-Feature-Engineering
#These are all my python code files for the course Machine Learning: Unsupervised Learning and Feature Engineering.

I recommend that you run these pograms in the following order:
1) global_clustering.py: this performs the global clustering, and identifies the main attributes of these clusters
2) silhouette_plot.py: This makes a silhouette plot for the global clustering, and this could have been in the same code, but as I have remembered to do this later on, it felt more authentic leaving it like this.
3) validation_characterization.py: This gives us even more insights into our clusters. Even though this doesn't give us pretty charts or plots, this povided me with the information of how to carry on and what my next steps should be.
4) targeted_subsegmentation.py: This gives us the plots for the subclusters and also the characteristics of those clusters in detail
5) strategic_profiling.py: this gives us the two pie charts, one for the global clustering and one for the subclustering, and it also gives us the "Trust Gap plot" which is also very useful.
